# Image semantic segmentation pipeline with PyTorch

## Abstract
This code is a pipeline for semantic segmentation which is based on [pytorch-unet](https://github.com/usuyama/pytorch-unet) and tested on synthetic images/masks.

## Pipeline
The pipeline consists of five parts:
- data preparation
- model creation
- model training
- data prediction
- index evaluation

Entry: `main.py`

## TODO
- [ ] real data
- [ ] index evaluation
- [ ] cross validation
